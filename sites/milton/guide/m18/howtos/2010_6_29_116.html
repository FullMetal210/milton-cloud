	<body>
		<p>Milton does all the character encoding for you, and supports extended character sets.</p>
		<p>So you're free to name your files and folders however you like. Milton will apply percentage encoding when generating hrefs (eg in PROPFIND responses) and xml encoding when generating other text fields such as the display name property.</p>
		<p>Milton decodes the requested URL before calling ResourceFactory.getResource(..) so again, there's no special handling required.</p>
		<p>Note that this means that you must not apply character encoding or decoding anywhere as this will result in double-encoded or double-un-encoded url's which will be incorrect.</p>
