		<p>Milton has broad client support, provided you conform to some necessary server configuration constraints. Note that these constraints aren't due to milton, they are due to the webdav requirements for particular client applications. For example, Finder on Mac OS requires locking support, and the Webdav-redirector client on windows requires the server to run on port 80.</p>
