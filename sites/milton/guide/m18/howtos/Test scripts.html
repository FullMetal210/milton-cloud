Bandwidth

=========

- Ping times should be at least 100ms for tests



- Bandwidth should be at most 50kBytes/s



Tests

=====

For all tests:



- User interface should not appear locked or stuck. It should

repaint and "not responding" should not be displayed by Windows

in title bar.



- Show signs of progress every 2 seconds.



- Must work in root directory as well as a subfolder.



1. Start Word/OO, open file requester at Webdav URL, 

browse folder, open small Word document, authenticated folder.

Document should be non-trivial in size. At least 2 seconds

to load.



Required result:



a. It should ask for login + password w/possibility to change user.



b. display document 



2. Save same document on top of old



3. Open document on one machine and verify that it shows up as locked

on another machine.



4. Disable network connection to machine that has document locked and

verify that the lock clears in 60 seconds(?).



5. Create folder from within file requester.

 

6. Save a large word file (should take more than 20 seconds to 

save).



7. Save and load excel spread sheet.



8. Abort saving of too large file. A file which is too large to save

should fail with grace / be abortable.



Operating system tests:

=======================



1. Open Explorer to webdav address and browse directory and

subdirectories. 



2. Copy large file on top of existing file. More than 10 seconds to

save.



3. Copy large file to new location. More than 10 seconds.



4. Download large file. More than 10 seconds.
