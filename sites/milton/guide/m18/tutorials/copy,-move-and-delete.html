		<h2>Copy</h2>

			User should be able to copy the document from one folder to another.
			<a href="/reference/milton-api/apidocs/com/bradmcevoy/http/CopyableResource.html">CopyableResource</a>
			provides the ability to make the resource copyable. All the classes that implements this interface must implement the method

		<h2>Move</h2>
		<p>
			<b>
				<a name="MoveableResource">Moving or Renaming:</a>
			</b>
			User should be able to rename the document. Milton provides the
			<a href="/reference/milton-api/apidocs/com/bradmcevoy/http/MoveableResource.html">MovableResource</a>
			Interface to enable the resource to be movable. All the classes which implements this resource must implement a method
			<a href="/reference/milton-api/apidocs/com/bradmcevoy/http/MoveableResource.html">moveTo</a>
			<br />
			<br />
			Note: underlying operation for Moving and renaming are same.

		<h2>Delete</h2>
		<p>As part of the WebDAV specifications, new method DELETE is added as an extension to the HTTP protocol. This method used to remove (delete) the Resource. For example removing the directory.</p>

		</p>
		<p>Milton API Provides the DeletableResource Interface which supports the DELETE WebDAV method. Implement this to allow your resource to be deleted by webdav clients. Milton will ensure there are no locks which prevent the delete, however the current user might have the resource locked in which case your implementation Usually milton will recursively call delete on all children within a collection being deleted. However you can prevent this my implementing DeletableCollectionResource which causes milton to ONLY call delete on the specific resource being deleted. In which case it is your responsibility to test for locks on all child resources. We will look into the details of the DeletableResource and sample code.</p>

			<a href="/reference/milton-api/apidocs/com/bradmcevoy/http/DeletableResource.html#delete()">delete()</a>
			: 	Non-recursive delete of this resource.

			<b>Example</b>
			<br />
			<br />
			For example, we will consider the scenario explained later in the
			<a href="example.html">Sample application [Document management Application]</a>
			. You need to have the ability to remove the Departments. Example uses the "Hibernate" to store the departments and documents. you need to implement "DeletableResource" interface and then write a logic to remove an entry in the database.

			</b>
		</p>
		<p>An extension to DeletableResource and CollectionResource, this interface adds a method to support efficient detection of child locks.</p>
		<p>In the case of deleting a collection resource it might be inefficient to check for locks by recursively walking through the collection. By implementing this interface you have the ability to use a more efficient approach.</p>
		<p>
			Developers need to implement the method
			<a href="/reference/milton-api/apidocs/com/bradmcevoy/http/DeletableCollectionResource.html#isLockedOutRecursive">isLockedOutRecursive</a>
			and need to write a logic to check whether this resource or its child resource is locked. This method returns the boolean value as a output.

		</p>
		<br />
		<h2>Output</h2>
		<p>you can move the documents from one folder to another or you can copy or it can be deleted. You can perform all these operations similar to the normal folders.</p>
