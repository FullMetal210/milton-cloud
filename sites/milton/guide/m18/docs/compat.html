		<h2>Recipe for broad client compatibility</h2>
		<p>So you want your webdav server to be accessible from windows XP to Win7, Linux, Mac OS and from the  	main office productivity suites Open Office and MS Office - right?	Here's how to do it:</p>
		<p>
			Note: All of these are
			<b>required!</b>
		</p>
		<h3>Server implementation requirements</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Your DAV webapp must have a root context path, ie "/". NOT "/webdav" etc</li>
			<li>Must run on port 80.</li>
			<li>Must have Digest authentication enabled</li>
			<li>Must support locking, including the awkward lock-null support for collections</li>
			<li>Must allow unauthenticated OPTIONS requests</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Client mapping requirements</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Do not specify a port number in the URL (this contradicts some widespread information)</li>
			<li>Do not specify user name in URL (ditto)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Live Demo</h3>
		<p>Connect to the following webdav address. Use the same credentials in the app context file in milton-filesystem-test, or ask the email group</p>
		<p>http://miltondemo.ettrema.com/</p>
		<p>
			This is very close to milton-filesystem-test. Feel free to use it to try out milton's webdav capabilities but please don't abuse it!
			<br />
			Do not store anything important there, all of the content in that repository will be deleted from time to time without notice.
		</p>
		<h3>Client compatibility summary</h3>
		<p>Note: where we refer to an operating system, we're actually referring to the native webdav client for that OS</p>

Make sure you mount is writable for the user accessing the mount.



Example:



sudo mount -t davfs
							<a href="https://yoursite.com/" class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E">"https://yoursite.com/"</a>
							your_mount_point -o

uid=your_username



We did find an issue w/ Ubuntu 10.04 and SSL that was worked around by

installing davfs2 from source. That appears to be an Ubuntu packaging

issue that will hopefully be fixed in the next release of Ubuntu.
