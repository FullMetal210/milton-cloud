		<title>Sample Application</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h2>Scenario:</h2>
		<p>we will consider the following real time scenario. There is a company ABC and it has departments like HR, Finance, IT, Sales.  Company needs a effective document management system i.e. Kind of central repository for documents. Company is now hiring for various departments. So we will build a system where users can upload, download and manage the resumes among the various departments. We use database for storing the objects. This example runs on tomcat and uses Hibernate for persistence layer. You can find the link to download the entire project in the Reference section.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Hence our application needs to provide the ability to</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Create a new department</li>
			<li>Remove the existing department</li>
			<li>Rename the department</li>
			<li>Upload the document</li>
			<li>Download the document</li>
			<li>Lock / unlock  the document  for overwrite prevention</li>
			<li>Check who updated the document recently and when</li>
			<li>Rename the document</li>
			<li>Copy the document from one department to another</li>
		</ul>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>As you aware WebDAV provides ability to map the drive or mount the drive so that user can work as if it were on the local system. They can use the native clients like windows explorer. We will use the existing database to store the details like departments and documents.</p>
		<p>We will build the application step by step. We will to use &ldquo;Hibernate&rdquo; for persistence.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h2>Design:</h2>
		<p>Here we have two important objects i.e., Documents and departments. Hence we will create two POJO objects representing them and those objects will be hibernate entities. Hibernate will take care of storing, retrieving those objects in the corresponding table.  Below diagram show the design of the sample Application.</p>

		<h2>Output:</h2>
		<p>Following is the final output of the sample application. Here, Windows Explorer is used as a WebDAV client and it displayes the departments as folder.</p>

		<h2>Resources:</h2>
		<p>There are three resource classes which implements the appropriate Milton Interfaces which provides the support for specific WebDAV methods. They are</p>

			<li>DocumentResource</li>
			<li>DepartmentResource</li>
			<li>CompanyResource</li>
		</ol>
