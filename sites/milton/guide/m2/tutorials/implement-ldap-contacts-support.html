		<title>Implement LDAP Contacts support</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>With Milton LDAP you can expose your contacts database over LDAP as well as CardDav. This extends native support for contacts to include MS Outlook and Mozilla Thunderbird, which do not have CardDav support.</p>
		<p>To implement LDAP support in your application you must do the following:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Implement
				<a href="https://github.com/miltonio/milton2/blob/master/milton-server/src/main/java/io/milton/ldap/LdapPrincipal.java">LdapPrincipal</a>
				- this represents a user who can access your server.
				<a href="https://github.com/miltonio/milton2/blob/master/examples/milton-ref/src/main/java/com/mycompany/TCalDavPrincipal.java">Example</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				Implement
				<a href="https://github.com/miltonio/milton2/blob/master/milton-api/src/main/java/io/milton/resource/LdapContact.java">LdapContact</a>
				- this represents an item in an addressbook.
				<a href="https://github.com/miltonio/milton2/blob/master/examples/milton-ref/src/main/java/com/mycompany/TContact.java">Example</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				Implement
				<a href="https://github.com/miltonio/milton2/blob/master/milton-server/src/main/java/io/milton/ldap/UserFactory.java">UserFactory</a>
				- a means to locate contacts, principals and authentication.
				<a href="https://github.com/miltonio/milton2/blob/master/examples/milton-ref/src/main/java/com/mycompany/TLdapUserFactory.java">Example</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				Create and start the
				<a href="https://github.com/miltonio/milton2/blob/master/milton-server/src/main/java/io/milton/ldap/LdapServer.java">LdapServer</a>
				. The reference implementation does this in its custom Configurator.
				<a href="https://github.com/miltonio/milton2/blob/master/examples/milton-ref/src/main/java/com/mycompany/MyMiltonConfigurator.java">Example</a>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Transactions</h2>
		<p>Note that LdapServer requests do not run in any conventional container managed lifecycle so common transaction management patterns (eg open view in request filters) can't be used. Its also dangerous to rely on anything using threadlocal variables, because a socket connection will handle many requests on a single thread.</p>
		<p>To solve this a LdapTransactionManager interface is provided. All requests in LdapServer are executed inside a Runnable wich is run by the provided LdapTransactionManager, which means they can easily be wrapped with a user managed transaction. If no explicit transaction management is required use the NullLdapTransactionManager.</p>
		<h2>CardDav Co-implementation</h2>
		<p>Typically milton applications implement both LDAP and Carddav support, to get broad native support for contacts. However there are some challenges to be overcome:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Carddav requires the application to accept and return contact information formatted according to the VCard standard, but LDAP requires a structured representation of the data. It is up to the application to decide on the persistence approach, ie to store the data as VCard text, as structured data, or both. Note that Carddav clients are sensitive to the format and layout of the data, so it is always safest to store the given unstructured text if possible</li>
			<li>The current LDAP&nbsp;server implementation requires access to the user's plain text password, but often web applications store only a one-way hashed form of the password making access to the plain text password impossible. Future implementations of milton's LdapServer might support hashed passwords.</li>
