		<title>Running on the root context</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>We need to run milton (or any webdav server) on the port 80 and the root context (/) for compatibility with Microsoft products (primarily win7)</p>
		<p>But there's been a few discussions lately about how practical this is. Many people have multiple apps running so feel that they just can't do it. Below is some options for dealing with this situation</p>
		<p>1. Grab a new IP&nbsp;address</p>
		<p>Server administrators have been dealing with this type of situation for years and the normal answer is simple. Just bind another IP&nbsp;address to the server and connect your milton app to that IP (on port 80 and the root context).</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>2. Combine webapps</p>
		<p>Milton is normally used as a servlet and as such completely controls all of the url's within a webapp - which precludes it being used in conjunction with a non-milton app. However, it can also be used from a servlet filter instead of a servlet.</p>
		<p>Doing so allows you to programattically determine whether to forward a request to milton's HttpManager, or to allow it to be processed normally (ie by the non-milton app)</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>3. The Hackville option</p>
		<p>So lets say you can't get another IP address (maybe you're running in EC2 and you've used all 5 they allow you). There is still an option, but its a bit hacky. Basically, all windows needs is to be able to issue an un-authenticated OPTIONS request to the root, and then subfolders down to where the content is. So if you're running some other non-milton app on the root you could actually add milton to it with some bogus resources which just provide the correct OPTIONS response.</p>
