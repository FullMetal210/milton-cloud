		<h2>Use MiltonFilter</h2>
		<p>Typically, milton has been integrated with MiltonServlet. However this is now deprecated and instead you should use one of Milton's servlet filter implementations, such as MiltonFilter. The reason is that many aspects of Webdav require running on the root (eg Windows 7 likes to do OPTIONS requests on the root to discover webdav capabilities), but if you run milton on a servlet mapped to /* then you can't use any other servlets. So, instead, use a milton filter which allows you to specify paths that should pass through to other servlets.</p>

		<h2>Configuration with HttpManagerBuilder and MiltonConfigurator</h2>
		<p>
			Milton's core processing is done with
			<a href="https://github.com/miltonio/milton2/blob/master/milton-server/src/main/java/io/milton/http/HttpManager.java">HttpManager</a>
			. HttpManager is created by
			<a href="https://github.com/miltonio/milton2/blob/master/milton-server/src/main/java/io/milton/config/HttpManagerBuilder.java">HttpManagerBuilder</a>
			, which exposes all of milton's configuration options in a manner which is easy to modify. HttpManagerBuilder is configured from MiltonFilter using an instance of
			<a href="https://github.com/miltonio/milton2/blob/master/milton-server/src/main/java/io/milton/servlet/MiltonConfigurator.java">MiltonConfigurator</a>
			. By default
			<a href="https://github.com/miltonio/milton2/blob/master/milton-server/src/main/java/io/milton/servlet/DefaultMiltonConfigurator.java">DefaultMiltonConfigurator</a>
			is used which provides init-parameter configuration of a few simple properties. To do further configuration implement your own and provide its classin the
			<strong>milton.configurator</strong>
			init parameter.
